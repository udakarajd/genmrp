The main motivation of this project is to build a solution for MRP with optimized lot sizing using Genetic Algorithms and parallel processing.
To archive this, model proposed by  D.J Stockton and L.Quinn will be implemented.
In implementation: Scala programming language and parallel programming techniques will be used.
